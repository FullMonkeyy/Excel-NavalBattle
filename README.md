# Excel-NavalBattle
So this is definitely my first expercience with video game developing. 
Just as you may read, I did not actually code any thing since this is a excel file. Although this fact, the game is completely fine and works as well. By using macros, I created a navle battle really interesting in my opinion. I've uploaded the game in this repository so in this way you can try the game it self.
However, you have to trust the file in order to enable the macros.

NOTE: 
I had never learned about algorithms and software developing before this project and I'm really proud of my game since when I developed the game I was 15 in the first grade of my high school with no experience.
